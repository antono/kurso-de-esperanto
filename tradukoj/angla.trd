[Lec12]
Label11=Transitive and intransitive verbs
Label2="Some verbs, called transitive verbs, take a direct object.  In lesson 2 we saw that a direct object is always in the accusative case.  Other verbs, called intransitive verbs, do not take a direct object.  For example,"
Label7=Something important happened.
Label8=I am very happy today.
Label9=They are already sleeping in their beds.
Label10=The young people danced very much.
Label12=Note
Label13=These verbs may have a complement using a preposition:
Label14=His father died because of cancer.
Label15=I am very glad about your happiness!
Label16=Some verbs which are ordinarily intransitive can sometimes take a direct object:
Label17=She is sleeping a deep sleep.
Label18=She danced a waltz with him.
Label19=All verbs with the suffix '-iĝi' are intransitive (no direct object).  They are often formed by adding '-iĝi' to a noun or to an adjective.  The meaning can generally be expressed by the English verb 'to become'.
Label21=In winter the waters freeze. (become ice)
Label22=She married (became a wife) her cousin. (Note that 'kuzo' is always male.)
Label23=Today the weather became warmer again.
Label24="'-iĝi' is often added to transitive verbs.  The result is an intransitive verb whose meaning can often by expressed by 'become' + a past participle.  So 'kuiri' = to cook, and 'kuirigxi' = to become cooked."
Label25="The crowd ran more slowly than the vehicle, which was rolling very fast."
Label26="Suddenly he found himself on the street, all alone."
Label27=At what time will the lesson start?
Label28=Masses of pedestrians moved on the sidewalks.
Label3=Verbs ending in '-iĝi' typically indicate a transition to a new state whose characteristics are indicated by the root.  The doer or perpetrator of the action is not specified.
Label29=Some verbs have no subject: (The grammatical subject 'it' in English has no real meaning.)
Label30=Yesterday it rained very much.
Label31="It is dawning, and I have to go home."
Label32=It was snowing very hard and he couldn't leave the cabin.
Label33=Verbs with the suffix  -IG-  are always transitive.  The meaning is often expressable by 'to make'.
Label34=The trip certainly made you tired.
Label35=The Southern sun burns his uncovered head. (makes it burn)
Label36=The father wants to marry off his older daughter immediately. (make her a wife)
Label37=Note
Label38=Always remember that the verb  \"esti\"  doesn't require the accusative.  Don't use the accusative after a preposition.
Label39="Certainly you already noted the extraordinary possibility of expression of Esperanto.  In fact, by adding various prefixes, suffixes and grammatical endings to a given root, you can create many words, some of them without a direct translation to English.  Some examples of word creation follow:"
Label40=Word making in Esperanto
Label41=Using prefixes and suffixes:
Label42=Note
Label43="Even if it is possible to build words with more than two prefixes and/or suffixes, in favor of clarity and elegance it is preferable to avoid such creations.  Thus, instead of \"belulineto\"  we prefer  \"eta belulino\".  The order in which affixes occur influences meaning:"
Label5="Joining roots.  The grammatical ending of the first element, often '-o', is usually omitted, but it may be retained to facilitate pronounceability."
